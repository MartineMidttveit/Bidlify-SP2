For semester project 2 I made an auction website called Bidlify. The website was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. 
My goal was to create an organized website that is easy to navigate, with a clean layout. 
The project was made based on the requirements, but I have also added additional features that I consider important for such a website.
